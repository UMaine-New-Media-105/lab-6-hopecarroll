Lab 6 challenge: The challenge was to have a sprite eat "the food" using key pressed. To do this I created a orange sprite with a function which 
ate the red "food" function. In order to move the orange sprite to the red sprite I used the "keyPressed function to move the ornage sprite around the canvas with the up and down and left and right arrows. The red food sprite was spawned in a different location everytime the game was played using the random command and assigning those to the foodX and foodY variables. Then using the dist command I was able to change the color of the orange sprite to red and have the food sprite disapear when the orange sprit collided with the food sprite. 
If I had more time I would have added the 5 spwans using a sperate variable and call that variable in draw and add it by one each time. 
I also would have added more ellaborate sprites but I wanted to understand the code before I did that.
